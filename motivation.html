        For most people, good balance is often taken for granted– until it’s compromised. 
        Whether it’s getting out of bed, walking down the street, or simply standing still, 
        maintaining balance is a seamless part of daily life. Yet, for millions of individuals, 
        especially older adults or those with certain medical conditions, even these simple tasks 
        can become daunting challenges. Balance disorders are much more than mere inconveniences 
        and can increase the risk of falls, a leading cause of injury and even mortality. 
    </p>
    <p>But before we continue any further, let’s define balance.</p>

    <section class = "balance">
    <h2>What is Balance?</h2>
    <p>
        Balance is the ability to maintain the body’s center of mass over its base of support. 
        The balance system is one of the most complex neural connections in the human central nervous
        system. It relies on input from multiple sources, including the labyrinth (inner ear), visual 
        cues, and somatosensory feedback from joints and tactile receptors. A properly functioning balance
        system allows an individual to see clearly while moving, identify orientation, determine direction
        and speed of movement and make automatic postural adjustments to maintain posture and stability. 
        Any disruptions to these inputs can lead to feelings of instability or a false sense of motion. This
        is otherwise known as vertigo or dizziness. 

    </p>
    <p>While balance is more often perceived as a relatively static state, it is actually a dynamic process 
        that involves constant adjustments to maintain stability. These adjustments, known as postural sway 
        or body sway, are subtle movements of the body–shifting the center of mass within the base of support 
        to counteract external forces like gravity or internal changes like muscle fatigue. 
    </p>
    <p>Postural sway is an integral part of balance control and it can reveal critical insights into how the 
        body intakes input sensory information to maintain equilibrium. 
    </p>

    <p>For instance, increased or irregular body sway may indicate that an individual is experiencing challenges 
        in processing input from their eyes, muscles/joints and ears, something that is often seen in people with 
        balance disorders. Studying these patterns can help researchers understand the mechanisms behind balance 
        and ways to improve stability.

    <h2>Virtual Reality Therapy</h2>
    <p>
        One such solution innovatively utilizes Virtual Reality (VR) as a platform for rehabilitation. Not just a 
        tool for entertainment, VR has been used in clinical and rehabilitative contexts to simulate real-world 
        environments that could promote sway and disrupt balance. These treatments help vulnerable individuals to 
        develop strategies to help improve balance and avoid falling. Through personalized rehabilitation programs, 
        VR-exercises can help retrain the brain to better integrate sensory inputs and target specific weaknesses in 
        balance control. The use of VR for studying the role of vision in regulating body sway is well established, 
        however there has been less research done into how incorporating music can influence sway.
